                    I’ve always loved design, but it has sometimes competed with music for my attention. In high school I probably spent as much time designing the posters for my viola recitals as I did practicing for them. Growing up in the D.C. area, I found a way to combine music with local politics: by playing string quartet gigs at embassies and political gatherings, including one at the Vice President’s mansion! Music and I were joined at the hip through my studies at Oberlin and The Juilliard school, but a repetitive stress injury struck and serendipitously prompted me to recommit to my other love: digital design. Now, after getting my AAS at Parsons and finishing delightful and challenging jobs at Barnes & Noble, Scholastic, and Marvel in NYC, I’ve returned to D.C. with my husband and two sons, and I’m geeked to find a new work home. Who knows – maybe I’ll end up gigging in a new way for the Vice President (BidenForPresident2016.com?)
