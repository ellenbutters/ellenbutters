                <h3>Motorcycle Pen & Ink, 2005</h3>

                <p>Done with both quill and micron pens, I based this drawing on a photo I took at an empty lot in New York City. I thought it would make an interesting black and white drawing because of the large range of values in both the bike and graffiti backdrop.
