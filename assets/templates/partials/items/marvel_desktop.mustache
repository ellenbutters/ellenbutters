               <h3>REBRANDING MARVEL DIGITAL</h3>
               <p>The first, and arguably biggest, task when I arrived at Marvel was establishing a new visual brand for Marvel Digital and getting all stakeholders to approve it. When I arrived, the apps, Web site, emails, and other digital communications had wildly disparate aesthetics and language.</p><p></p><p>I first interviewed all the departments at Marvel (including Publishing, Marketing, Biz/Dev, Content, and Product) so I could understand the essence of the Marvel and Marvel Digital brands. The second step was writing the Creative Brief (shown here), which all departments then signed off on.</p>

               <h3>REBRANDING &mdash; MOOD BOARDS</h3>
               <p>The design team completed 3 rounds of mood boards, each time getting reviews from several departments and taking feedback. Although this was a tedious process, it was integral to achieving buy-in from the various teams. Since the Marvel Web site would eventually be made Responsive, we had to think about how our styling would translate to both large and small screens, as well as how heavy the code would be.</p>

               <h3>REBRANDING &mdash; FINAL MOOD BOARD</h3>
               <p>The final mood board was based on our most minimal direction, though we borrowed elements from several boards. Stakeholders liked massive images with plenty of breathing room, the bold contrast of black & white typography, the restrained use of the Marvel Red as an action color, and the use of an angle as a framing device that spoke to the energy and power of the brand. </p><p></p><p>The final result – a simple, bold, and modern design – took contrasting Marvel imagery (movie photo-realism vs. comic illustration vs. game CGI) and united them under one visual umbrella.</p>

                <h3>REBRANDING &mdash; WEB FONT</h3>
                <p>One of the most difficult tasks was choosing a font and getting approval for the license. We went with Trade Gothic, because it was strong, bold, and timeless, and it had all the weights we needed. Getting it approved was challenging because a font license had not been budgeted for that fiscal year. Even after I was able to make a case for it to Marvel leadership, we still had months of legal negotiations to finalize a contract with Monotype, the type foundry.</p>

                <h3>IMPLEMENTING THE REBRAND</h3>
                <p>After we got final sign-off on a mood board and font, we worked with Product Managers to do a complete face lift of our <a href="http://marvel.com/" target="_blank">Web site</a> and apps, including much-needed UX improvements and some key new features along the way, like providing more editorial controls to the Content Team. We worked with Dev in an agile methodology, starting with the Home Page and Comics section. </p><p></p><p>Shown here is the new Home Page opposite the old one, which highlights how much we enlarged the images and typography for maximum impact while keeping usability intact.</p>

                <h3>RESPONSIVE MARVEL.COM</h3>
                <p>Most of our UX changes came from building a Responsive site design. My team used an “All Breakpoints At Once” design methodology, while ensuring that the content would be light enough for mobile use. We innovated some design paradigms for complex items such as filters. </p><p></p><p>Everything was designed to be reusable and we created a live Style Guide, which was a library of our modules and UI patterns. This was not only indispensable for our own designs going forward, but third party dev teams also used it to build co-branded microsites. The all-mighty Style Guide more than doubled the speed of development and ensured brand consistency. <br><a href="http://marvel.com/" target="_blank">View at Marvel.com</a></p>

                <h3>HERO IMAGES</h3>
                <p>One of the discoveries of our rebranding process was that simply making Marvel’s gorgeous, proprietary imagery ENORMOUS and framed with plenty of white space, was enough to establish a strong brand. Most of our detail pages were thus treated to HUGE hero graphics, shown here in the Comic Events section. </p><p></p><p>One of the key Dev efforts was making these images responsive in both height and width so users would always know there was more content on the page for them to scroll and see. <br>See live examples <a href="http://marvel.com/comics/events/314/age_of_ultron" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://marvel.com/characters" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>UPDATING BRANDING EVERYWHERE</h3>
                <p>After establishing a solid visual brand and a set of reusable UI patterns, we redesigned all of Marvel’s other digital communications, such as its digital comics app & Web site, print comics Web site, Rewards program Web site, Augmented Reality app, all emails, etc…</p><p></p><p>When Apple iOS7 launched, we had no real problems cohesing our brand with theirs, since our aesthetic was already largely in keeping with Apple’s. We did, however, redesign our App Icon family to be even more minimalistic.</p>

                <h3>MARVEL UNLIMITED PROGRAM</h3>
                <p>One of our most exciting projects was launching Marvel Unlimited, a new digital comics subscription program – the Netflix of comics. My team designed the new logo, branding, app interface, and corresponding web interface, including our first proprietary checkout flow. </p><p></p><p>The new program was a huge success, and we soon expanded it to a special “plus” tier that included exclusive figurine and comics collectibles. This was one of a few print projects my team completed, and it was great fun! <br><a href="http://marvel.com/comics/unlimited" target="_blank">View Marvel Unlimited on Marvel.com</a>.</p>
